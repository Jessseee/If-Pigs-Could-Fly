# If-Pigs-Could-Fly
In the last two decades many impressive cable-driven flying camera systems are developed that provide unique camera angles for events in large stadiums. An example of this is the Skycam, this system is used for events and sports games such as the NFL. For this project we were inspired by devices like the SkyCam to build a simpler version of a cable suspended flying system.
  
The aim of this project was to produce a system that is capable of suspending the artworks made by EXOOT above their spectators. An important requirement was that the system can “fly” the artworks fluently and savely above the spectators. The final product is a construction of wires and pulleys with servo motors to control the movement of the suspended object. The motors can be controlled using an application on a smartphone or by a physical controller. The artwork can be controlled by a person or autonomously over a prefix path.

In this directory you can find all the code used to make our first prototype work.
